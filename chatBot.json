"{\"input\": \"How can i make my budget better. what are\", \"response\": \"Given MothersCradle's limited budget and punk music style, focus on DIY marketing: guerrilla tactics and leveraging the local Athens, GA scene. For marketing, prioritize free methods like local show promotion through flyers, social media engagement, and building relationships with local music bloggers/press. Invest in affordable website builders like Bandzoogle for their website, which cater to musicians. Instead of broad ads, target local college radio stations or venues for cheaper, highly relevant placements. For travel, coordinate carpools with bandmates and utilize budget-friendly accommodations like hostels or Airbnbs when touring. Explore open-source or free trial versions of music software before purchasing.\"}"
