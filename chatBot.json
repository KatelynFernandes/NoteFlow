Focus marketing efforts on free platforms like social media (Instagram, TikTok) and local community engagement (local radio).

Optimize travel by carpooling to local gigs and seeking out free lodging options. Choose free or open-source software alternatives. Track spending closely and reallocate funds as needed based on what yields the best results.\\n\"}"
